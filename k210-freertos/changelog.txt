Date:   Sun Jan 27 16:02:55 2019 +0100

    Changed MPy Object representation to MICROPY_OBJ_REPR_D
      as K210 is 64-bit CPU, it better suits the architecture
      and far less heap operations are performed
    
    Added some functions to 'machine' module
      K210 CPU frequency can now be set to higher than default value
      Frequencies from 200 MHz - 800 MHz are supported (default: 400 MHz)
      Frequencies above 400 MHz are considerd as overclocking,
      but works on most boards
      added functions:
        'machine.freq()', 'machine.reset()' and 'machine.random'
    
    Fixed (partially) issues with using 'ampy' and 'rshell'
      'ampy' now works
      'rshell' still have some issues with sending files...
